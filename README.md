Doc-Ocean was a startup launched in 2015 with an aim of uberising health care, the idea was to connect patients to the nearby health care professionals (Doctor, Nurses)
and avail of the services in the comfort of home. 

Doctor app Android is basically a front-facing app for health care professional where they can see the request coming from patients, their address details, and service
needs, they can accept and reject the request accordingly. 

Unfortunately we shutdown the startup in the 6-month span of time because of a lack of financial backup while we needed many government approvals to run the business
for healthcare startups. 

This is an Android app which was used by health care professionals to receive the order in real time. 

We have decided to opensource this so that others can get benefited from our hard work and passion.
