# doctor-app-android

Doc-Ocean was an startup launched in 2015 with an aim of uberising health care, the idea was connect pateints to the nearby health care professionals (Doctor, Nurses)
and avail the services in the comfort of home. 

Doctor app Android is basically front facing app for health care professional where they can see the request coming from patents , their address details and service
needs , they can accept and reject the request accordingly. 

Unfortunatley we shutdown the startup in 6 month span of time because of lack of financial backup while we needed many goverement approval to run the business
for healthcare startups. 

We have decided to opensource this so that other can get benefited by our hard work and passion.
